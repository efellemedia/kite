# Proton
An elegant collection of renderless Vue.js UI components. Don't be constrained by underlying CSS frameworks. Proton provides the functionality, leaving you to roll your own styles or make use of utility-first CSS frameworks, such as [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), to fit your project and needs. This project is still in active development and is not ready for production use. There may be breaking changes between releases as we figure out our API. Thanks for understanding :v:
